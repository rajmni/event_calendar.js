event_calendar.js
=================

Nice and easy event calender in JavaScript

give the $events json of unix timestamps, like this:

```javascript
[{"start_time":1366790400, "end_time":1366794000}, {"start_time":1366822800,"end_time":1366826400}]
```

and it will populate the calender with those events.
